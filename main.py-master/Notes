Welcome to the Black Magic Game!

How to Play:

'Player 1' does not know how black magic works
The 'Black Magic Guru' does know how black magic works
the 'Computer' does know how black magic works


'Player 1' will look around the room and choose an item they want the Magic Guru to guess.

The 'Computer' will ask the 'Magic Guru' if random items are the item 'Player 1' chose.

The 'Magic Guru' wins the game if they correctly guess the item 'Player 1' chose.

*Note

    The list of items in the 'Itemlist' module is for a specific room. To customize the game, add your own items and corresponding colors
    found within the room you are in.

        *Note

            Make sure you use the same formatting (no CAPS) when revising the 'ItemList' or answering the 'Computer'.
